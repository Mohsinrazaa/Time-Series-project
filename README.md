# Time-Series-projects
## 1.Time-Series Analysis usnig FB-Prophet

**Goal:**
> Predictions for April, May, June, July, August, September 2021.
## 2. Time Series Forecasting - Autoregression (AR)

**Goal**
> Forecast time series with the Autoregression (AR) Approach. 1) JetRail Commuter, 2) Air Passengers, 3) Function Autoregression with Air Passengers, and 5) Function Autoregression with Wine Sales.

## 3.Time series forecasting using ARIMA models

In this project, you are requested to demonstrate Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model and use it to forecast a time series. Perform the following:

> 1.	Provide brief description of ARIMA model and explain how it is used. Describe its parameters.
> 2.	Select a stochastic time series of that describes a phenomenon. 
> 3. Using COVID-19 infections in Saudi Arabia Dataset. 

## 4. ARIMA with Fourier terms

> The goal of this notebook is to show how to tune ARIMA model with additional regressors. We will add some Fourier terms to capture multiple seasonality and compare the best      model with TBATS model.

> Dataset use  Web Traffic Time Series Forecasting from kaggle

## Finding Best Distribution that Fits Data using Fitter

> Finding the Best Distribution that Fits Your Data using Pythonâ€™s  `Fitter` Library
> Also finding the Z score and precentile for lognoramal form.
